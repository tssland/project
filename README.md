# US ACCIDENTS CAPSTONE PROJECT
### Description
This is a countrywide traffic accident dataset, which covers 49 states of the United States. The data is collected from February 2016 to December 2019, using several data providers, including two APIs that provide streaming traffic incident data. These APIs broadcast traffic data captured by a variety of entities, such as the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road-networks. Currently, there are about 3.0 million accident records in this dataset. Check here to learn more about this dataset.
### Content
This data has been collected in real-time, using multiple Traffic APIs. Currently, it contains data that is collected from February 2016 to December 2019 for the Contiguous United States. Check here to learn more about this dataset.
### Inspiration
US-Accidents can be used for numerous applications such as real-time accident prediction, studying accident hotspot locations, casualty analysis and extracting cause and effect rules to predict accidents, and studying the impact of precipitation or other environmental stimuli on accident occurrence.
